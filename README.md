# SRGen

A Shadowrun 5 character generator.

## State

This project is very much work in progress and currently pretty far from being
useful for any real use case.

## Data Files

Data files (anything in the `src/common/data/` directory) contain information
from Shadowrun 5 source books. This data was simply brought into a machine readable
format but not authored by me.
Note that these data files are not copyrighted by me and are *not* released
under the MIT license (which applies to the rest of the source code of this
project).

## Links

There's a Travis CI build available:
